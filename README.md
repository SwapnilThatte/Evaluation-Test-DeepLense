# Evaluation-Test-DeepLense

This repository contains solutions to following tasks:

1. Common Test I. Multi-Class Classification

2. Specific Test III. Image Super-resolution

    a. Task III.A

    b. Task III.B

The solution is implemented in pytorch framework on kaggle. For *Common Test I*, single P100 GPU is used while for *Specific Test III* 2x T4 GPUs have been utilized.

The details of model architecture, model weights can be found in test specific directory.
